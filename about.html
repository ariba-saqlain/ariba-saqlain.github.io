                    <center>Many people ask, why Computer Science? <br><br> Well growing up I've always been interested in computer games, different types of technology, and how they work. I decided to take a programming course in high school and not even one week in, I had already made up my mind- I wanted to do this for the rest of my life! I was amazed by the concept of writing a few lines of code and seeing a blank screen transform into a dynamic, compelling program. <br><br> Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University. I have also worked at Manulife Financial as a Test Developer Co-op in the Quality Assurance Department. Through this position, I gained an excellent understanding of software and testing life cycles. Moving forward, I would love the opportunity to work at an organization where I can showcase my wide variety of skills.

                            As much as I love singing in the shower, I wanted to take my voice to the next level and start recording. I put my audio/video editing skills to the test and produced some amazing covers. After posting them online, I was surprised by the amount of people who reached out and told me they enjoyed my music. I'm really glad that I was able to turn my hobby of singing into a skill that I could share with everyone.

                            As a computer science major, I spend a lot of time in front of the screen so I decided to try something different. I recently joined a beginner hip hop class at Laurier and had the opportunity to perform in the Fall Showcase. Thanks to the incredible experience I had, I enrolled in a few more classes this term including Afro-Beat/Dancehall and Intermediate Contemporary.

                            Growing up, my family and I have had several cats. When it was time for me to move out and start university, I adopted my own little troublemaker. His name is Meelo and I can't be thankful enough for all the joy he's brought into my life. I'm also a huge fan of orcas- also known as killer whales, but unfortunately I can't have one of those as a pet! However, I've done the next best thing which is to adopt an orca through the World Wildlife Fund. By making a donation, I helped protect the species as a whole along with the habitat they live in.
